Version 1.4.1:
- xasm: Fixed bug in processing of declaration of array of user-defined type
- xasm: Fixed bug that lead to no error message when declaring an uninitialized variable of non-existing user-defined type

- xlnk: Fixed memory leak in RAM allocator
Version 1.4.0:

- xasm: LABEL directive can take specific address as argument
- xasm: constraints can be communicated to linker on how contents of data segments should be mapped to RAM
- xasm: PUBLIC modifier can be specified directly when defining a variable
- xasm: fixed bug in code generation of exported string constants
- xlnk: prints the filename and location of the source of a link-time error (if unit assembled with --debug switch)
- xlnk: rewrote data segment mapping function to take zeropage and alignment constraints into account
- xlnk: improved code relocation
- xlnk: fixed linker script parsing bug
Version 1.3.5:
- xasm: added ability to declare storage for array of user-defined types, C-style (works for native types too)
- xasm: added ability to specify the type of data that a label addresses
- xasm: fixed bug in code generation of storage of user-defined types
- xasm: fixed some error detection and parsing woes
- xasm: added DEFINE directive (same semantics as EQU, but potentially more compact)
- xlnk: fixed code relocation bug
- xlnk: implemented bank operator (^)
- xlnk: --verbose switch now gives helpful info on what the linker is doing
Version 1.3.0:
- xasm: added support for user-defined records (RECORD directive, MASK operator)
- xasm: added WHILE directive
- xasm: implemented ELIF directive
- xasm: improved --define switch: value can now be given (i.e. --define a=10)
- xasm: SIZEOF operator now works on variable identifiers too
- xasm: fixed bug that prevented single-character identifiers from working
- xasm: added --no-warn switch to suppress warnings
- xasm: early support for --verbose switch
Version 1.2.0:
- xasm: support for forward/backward branches

Version 1.1.0:
- xasm: support for structs, unions and enums
- xasm: support for anonymous macros (REPT)
- xasm: new directives: PROC, LABEL, PAD, MESSAGE
- xasm: syntactic improvements
- xasm: important bug fixes for IF/ELSE and INCBIN
- xasm: added switch: --swap-parens
- xasm: improved literal expression folding
- xasm: preliminary support for --define=IDENT switch
Version 1.0.2:
- xasm, xlnk: not using argp for argument parsing anymore; increased portability
- xasm: removed X86-dependent timing code
Version 1.0.1:
- xlnk: fixed bug in code relocation
- xlnk: fixed bug in 'pad' script command execution
- xasm: fixed bug that made xasm crash when expanding a macro with no arguments
- xasm: fixed bug in error location output (sometimes filename would be "(null)")
- updated documentation
